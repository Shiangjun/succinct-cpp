Succinct
========

C++ Implementation of Succinct (http://succinct.cs.berkeley.edu).

Succinct is a data-store than enables queries directly on a compressed
representation of data. With basic primitives of random acces, search
and fast counts of arbitrary substrings on unstructured data (flat files),
Succinct can provide a rich set of queries on semi-structured or structured
data without requiring any secondary indexes.
